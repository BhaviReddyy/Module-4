Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of a web application that the user directly sees and uses in a browser. It focuses on the look, feel, and interaction of the application.

  User Interface 
Frontend is responsible for creating the visual layout of the application. It includes buttons, forms, text, images, navigation bars, and page structure. HTML is used for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

  User Interaction 
Frontend handles how users interact with the application. This includes clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling pages, and getting instant feedback like validation messages or alerts without refreshing the page.

  Communication with Backend 
Frontend sends requests to the backend server using APIs. It sends user data (such as login details or form inputs) and receives responses like success messages or data to display on the screen.

Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend is the server-side part of a web application that works behind the scenes. It manages logic, data, and security.

  Server-Side Processing
Backend processes requests coming from the frontend. It performs calculations, applies rules, and decides what response should be returned to the user.

  Database Handling
Backend interacts with databases to store, retrieve, update, and delete data. For example, saving user details, product information, or order history.

  Security and Authentication
Backend ensures security by handling user authentication and authorization. It protects sensitive data, verifies user identity, and prevents unauthorized access.

Q3. Business Logic

Business logic refers to the rules and decision-making processes that control how an application works according to business requirements. It defines what actions are allowed and how data should be processed.

Business logic usually exists in the backend and connects user actions with database operations.

 Real-World Examples

1. E-commerce Website  
   Calculating the final bill amount, applying discounts, checking product availability, and calculating tax.

2. Banking Application
   Checking account balance before allowing money transfer and enforcing daily transaction limits.

3. Food Delivery Application
   Calculating delivery charges based on distance, applying coupon codes, and estimating delivery time.

Q4. Client–Server Model

The client–server model is a system where tasks are divided between the client and the server.

 Client
The client is the user-side application such as a web browser or mobile app. It sends requests to the server and displays the response to the user.

 Server
The server is a system that receives requests from the client, processes them, and sends back appropriate responses.

 Communication Between Client and Server
Communication happens through a request–response process using HTTP or HTTPS. The client sends a request, the server processes it, and then returns data or results.

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-tier architecture divides a web application into three separate layers to improve organization and scalability.

 Presentation Layer
This layer is the frontend of the application. It interacts directly with the user and displays information.

 Application (Business) Layer
This layer contains the business logic. It processes user requests and acts as a bridge between the presentation layer and the data layer.

 Data Layer
This layer manages the database. It stores and retrieves data required by the application.

 Why This Architecture Is Used
Three-tier architecture is used because it improves security, makes the application easier to maintain, and allows each layer to be developed independently.

Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is widely used as a backend language because of its speed and flexibility.

 Performance
JavaScript uses an event-driven and non-blocking model, which allows it to handle multiple requests efficiently.

 Ecosystem
JavaScript has a large ecosystem with many libraries and tools that help developers build applications faster.

 Popular Backend Frameworks
Frameworks like Express.js and NestJS make it easy to build scalable backend applications using JavaScript.
